    description: BingeSquad is an app I built to work with the new version of rails 6. On the app you can publish or join events with random people, from watching a movie, to binging your favourite series, even an episode of an anime.
    description_2: Sadly, The app doesn’t do all the work. The event’s creator must add a discord link for users to use on the day of the gathering in order to join the platform and watch the movies. The owner manages everything on discord.
    description_3: Basic and a lot of work ... I know. I only had a month and it was for fun and an educational experience. But you meet fantastic people from with this hard work "insert winky face"
    description_4: With BingeSquad you can meet new people during these trying times and bond over your favourite movies. Or watch that dang film that has been collecting dust at the bottom of some mystical list, maybe that old show you just can’t find anywhere.
